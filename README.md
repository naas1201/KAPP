# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Security Note

⚠️ **Warning:** The seeding script (`npm run seed:prod-staff-accounts`) creates accounts with known hard-coded passwords. This is **insecure** for production use. If you use this script in production, you must immediately change the passwords or remove these accounts before publishing to general users. See `docs/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` for details.
